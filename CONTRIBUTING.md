## Categories

---

> We want the list to grow organically, but we also want the list to stay consistent.

---

Check the [README.md](https://github.com/zimdevs/dev-awesome) for the current categorization of our page.

- DO NOT add another category if an existing category will do
- DO NOT edit existing category names, hierarchy or ordering, [submit an issue](https://github.com/zimdevs/dev-awesome/issues), we will decide together
- DO keep categories in alphabetic order
- DO keep category names short
- DO use Title Case for category names
- DO keep the maximum category depth to 2. This is enough to keep things organized, while still being readable.
- DO add new categories to the table of contents

## Entries

---

> Each entry MUST be consistent, or the list gets very difficult to read.

---

- DO use this format for your entries, pull requests with different formats will be rejected

```plaintext
- [Name of library / tool / website etc..](https://direct-link-to-easiest-place-to-read-more-about-it.com) - One sentence description, from the creators. The reason why you have added it, how has it helped you?
```

- DO [submit an issue](https://github.com/zimdevs/dev-awesome/issues) if you would like to change format, we will decide together!
- DO add an entry that links to another awesome list, if you found it useful, it definitely belongs here

### Examples:

- [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) - A specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages. Commit messages are very opinionated, no right choice, why not use a standard that is already well documented?

- [pubtrends.dev](https://pubtrends.dev/) - Compare dart & flutter packages. Useful for looking for alternatives to a package you are using or have googled.
