# Contribution Guidelines

This list is intended to help developers in any language to be better and faster at their job!

Have something that can help, add it to README.md and create a pull request!

Want to help screen pull requests? Ask in your pull request, we are open to admins for the page.

## Style

This repo follows the same format as any other awesome list out there, some examples are:

<https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java>

<https://github.com/sorrycc/awesome-javascript>

<https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter>

<https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome>

## Categories

Check the README.md for the current categorization of our page.

We want the list to grow organically, so feel free to add a new category, but we also want the list to stay consistent, so don't create a new category if an existing on will do.

If you would like to recategorize, we are open to that too! Open an issue with your proposal and we can all discuss there.

Keep the maximum category depth to 2. This should be enough to keep things organized, while still being readable.

## Entries

Each entry should follow this format:

```plaintext
- [Name of library / tool / website etc..](https://direct-link-to-easiest-place-to-read-more-about-it.com)
```

## Table of Contents

The page maintains a table of contents for easy navigation, when you add a category, please add it to the table of contents.
